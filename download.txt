Religious movements
Scotland: As of the 2011 census; 53.9 percent of the scotish population was christian, and the church of scotland has held 32.4% of the religion in scotland, and the other major religions in scotland includer: the cathlic church, which accounts for 15.8 percent of the population. And scotland's third largest church is the scottish episcopal, 

People of Color: Over 92% or nine in ten black churchgoers, attendees of primary Black Churches state that their church didn’t get affected by the pandemic that much. Pandemic, and this could be a result of churches in these regions being more prepared for something like this, because most people in the minority went there more often than not. 


Women's Rights
People of color -Affect: 
1780 and 1807 was the first recorded date of a widowed black woman voting, you might have noticed I stated widowed, as married black women and their property automatically belong to their husband. Because the 1800’s was a crappy time for women’s voting, without factoring black women voting, because that would take untill the 19th ammendment which states “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.”.

People of the U.S. -Affect: 
Before the 16th century, women would be treated as witches if they convinced someone to marry them in high heels. in the mid 16’th century Massachusetts made abuse illegal. In the 17’th Century, women were now allowed to own or manage property in their name if the husband was mentally or physically unable to do so.
In the 19’th century, from 1820’s through the 1900’s abortions were outlawed. It took until 1920 for the 19’th amendment until women’s suffrage was allowed by law, so in the big picture it took us longer than a lot of countries to make our bill of rights actually true.
